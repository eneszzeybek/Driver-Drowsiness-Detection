# Dataset Information

Our dataset includes 1452 images. 726 images for closed eyes, 726 images for opened eyes.

# Conclusion

We used the Pytorch framework to apply CNN in the dataset. 

In this project, we have two steps. Firstly, we train a model that uses binary classification CNN to label whether the drivers are drowsy or not. Finally, applying a computer vision technique called dlib landmarks detection, we will detect the eyes of the driver for ten seconds of time to check whether the driver is sleepy or awake by using our CNN model in real-time.
